# GitHub Integration

Gitpod comes with a [GitHub](https://github.com/) integration that allows you to start Gitpod workspaces from any GitHub project.

## Starting Workspaces

To start a workspace from a GitHub project, prefix the GitHub URL with `gitpod.io/#` as described in [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/).

## Enabling Prebuilds

To enable [prebuilt workspaces](/docs/prebuilds/) for your GitHub project you need to install the [Gitpod GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/gitpod-io) and configure it for the GitHub user or organization that the project belongs to. Install the app as described in the [prebuilds page](/docs/prebuilds/#on-github).
